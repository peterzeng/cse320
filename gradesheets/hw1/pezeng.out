[RUN ] basecode_tests_suite::help_system_test
USAGE: bin/sequitur [-h] -c|-d [-b]
   -h       Help: displays this help menu.
   -c       Compress: read bytes from standard input, output compressed data to standard output.
   -d       Decompress: read compressed data from standard input, output raw data to standard output.
            Optional additional parameter for -c (not permitted with -d):
               -b           BLOCKSIZE is the blocksize (in Kbytes, range [1, 1024])
                            to be used in compression.
